# CounterApp

My first Android application. It's main purpose was to help me learn Android programming.

This app allows the user to make Counters that can be incremented or decremented. Each counter has a title, and if there are more counters than fit on the screen, the user can scroll the list of counters. Counters are persistent between uses of the app.
